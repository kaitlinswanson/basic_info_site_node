PROJECT: BASIC INFORMATIONAL SITE

This is a simple Node website made as an exercise for The Odin Project. The goal of this project was to get comfortable with the basics of Node.js and make a simple website where changing the URL will change the HTML that is being shown on the page. 

The assignment: 
http://localhost:8080/ displays the 'Homepage'
http://localhost:8080/about displays the 'About' section
http://localhost:8080/contact-me displays the 'Contact Me' section
Anything else will show the 404 page.
